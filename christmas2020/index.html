                <p id="card-msg">John began his second year of his postdoc research position and moved from Johns Hopkins University to the Space Telescope Science Institute. Priscilla expanded her role at the BMS Foundation as lead of the US Health Disparities portfolio, which focuses on cardiovascular and immunologic diseases. Despite the pandemic, we grew closer to our church and community in Baltimore. John recently became an elder at Sowebo Community Church, participated in P.R.O.Action community organizing events, and mentored a student through the CollegeBound Foundation.</p>

                <p id="card-msg">At the start of the COVID-19 lockdown, we learned that we were soon to become parents! Fortunately, both of us had the privilege to work remotely throughout Priscilla's pregnancy. On November 7, we welcomed baby Bethel Vera Wu (吴恩慧) into our family. </p>

                <p id="card-msg"><blockquote><b>Bethel</b> means House of God. <b>Vera</b> is derived from the word meaning truth. 吴 (<b>Wú</b> in Mandarin) is the family name. 恩 (<b>ēn</b>) means grace, and 慧 (<b>huì</b>) means wisdom.</blockquote></p>

                <p id="card-msg">We wish you and your loved ones a safe and happy holiday season! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>
