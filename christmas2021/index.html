							<h2>Cheers to 2021!</h2>
							<p>"It takes a village to raise a child."
							This was all too true in our first year of parenthood. We were both extremely fortunate to have parental leave, the option to work from home, and wonderful support from family and friends during Bethel's first year. We experienced and celebrated many firsts including rolling, eating solids, crawling, and babbling!
							</p>
							<p>
							It was also a year of blessings in our workplaces: Priscilla was promoted to Program Director, and John will soon be joining the STScI permanent staff as a tenure-track Assistant Astronomer! We'll be sticking around Baltimore for the foreseeable future and are excited to continue planting roots and building our home in Charm City.
							</p>
							<p>
							We wish you and your loved ones a safe and happy holiday season! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
							</p>

							Priscilla, John, and Bethel</p>
