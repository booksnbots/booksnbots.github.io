                <p id="card-msg">Our new year started out with a positive pregnancy test, growing our family to four as we welcomed baby Basil Ezra Wu (吳述恩) in August. </p>

                <p id="card-msg">Baz (rhymes with jazz) is Greek for royalty and one of the early saints; Ezra is derived from the Hebrew word for helper. 吴 (wú) is the family name, 述 (shù) means to declare, and 恩 (ēn) means grace.</p>

                <p id="card-msg">John was named <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-019">Maryland's Outstanding Young Scientist</a>, led a <a href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/evaluating-llm-performance-in-research-astronomy/">JSALT research team</a> over the summer, and took on a new role as the Applied AI Scientist in the STScI Data Science Mission Office. Priscilla continued developing grantmaking support and strategic initiatives within the Aging portfolio at The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation. Bethel loves playing hide-and-seek, watching/reading Bluey, and creating towns from Duplo blocks and magnetic tiles. Parental leave has given our family new opportunities to explore and cherish Baltimore and Maryland.</p>

                <p id="card-msg">Wishing you and your loved ones a safe and happy holiday season!</p>
